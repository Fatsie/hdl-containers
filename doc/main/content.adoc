== Collections and architectures

Images are organised in _collections_ and built for multiple architectures.
A _collection_ is a set of images which share a common ancestor; a base layer.
Having images with a common ancestor allows reducing bandwidth and disk usage when pulling several of them.
See https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/#images-and-layers[docs.docker.com: About storage drivers | Images and layers].


Collections:

* `debian/bullseye` based on `ARCHITECTURE/debian:bullseye-slim` (default)
* `debian/buster` based on `ARCHITECTURE/debian:buster-slim`
* `centos/7` based on `ARCHITECTURE/centos:7`

Architectures:

* https://hub.docker.com/u/amd64[amd64] (default)
* https://hub.docker.com/u/arm32v7[arm32v7]
* https://hub.docker.com/u/arm64v8[arm64v8]
* https://hub.docker.com/u/ppc64le[ppc64le]
* https://hub.docker.com/u/s390x[s390x]
* https://hub.docker.com/u/mips64le[mips64le]
* https://hub.docker.com/u/riscv64[riscv64]

Each image is published to image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-gcr.io/hdl--containers/&#91;ARCHITECTURE/&#93;&#91;COLLECTION/&#93;IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=Google%20Cloud&logoColor=f2f1ef[] and image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-ghcr.io/hdl/&#91;ARCHITECTURE/&#93;&#91;COLLECTION/&#93;IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=GitHub&logoColor=f2f1ef[].

However, the `ARCHITECURE` and `COLLECTION` are optional because:

* Images for the default architecture are mirrored to image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-gcr.io/hdl--containers/COLLECTION/IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=Google%20Cloud&logoColor=f2f1ef[] and image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-ghcr.io/hdl/COLLECTION/IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=GitHub&logoColor=f2f1ef[].
* Images of the default collection are mirrored to image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-gcr.io/hdl--containers/ARCHITECTURE/IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=Google%20Cloud&logoColor=f2f1ef[] and image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-ghcr.io/hdl/ARCHITECTURE/IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=GitHub&logoColor=f2f1ef[].
* Images of the default collection for the default architecture are mirrored to https://hub.docker.com/u/hdlc[image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-docker.io/hdlc-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=Docker&logoColor=f2f1ef[title='Docker Hub']].
* Images of the default collection for the default architecture which are not `build` or `pkg` are mirrored to image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-gcr.io/hdl--containers/IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=Google%20Cloud&logoColor=f2f1ef[] and image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-ghcr.io/hdl/IMAGE-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=GitHub&logoColor=f2f1ef[].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Image names and tags in this documentation are provided without the _registry prefix_.
Hence, one of the prefixes listed above needs to be used when actually pulling/using the images.
See link:ug/index.html[User Guide] for further details.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The table below shows the tools available in the default collection for the default architecture.
Some tools are available in a subset of collections or for a subset of architectures only.
Browse the registries and/or the Continuous Integration workflows for finding images available in collections other than
the default.
====

== Tools and images

By default, latest development versions (branches `master`|`main`) of tools are built.
Then, smoke tests are executed and, if successful, the corresponding images are updated in the registries.
However, some specific tools are _not_ built from sources, but installed through system package managers.
Those are marked with `!` in the table below.

[NOTE]
====
Package images are not to be used for executing the tools, but for composing images including multiple resources.
See link:dev/index.html#_package_images[Development: Package images] for further details.
