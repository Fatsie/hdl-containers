== Collections

In order to reduce bandwidth and disk usage when pulling multiple of the images provided in this project, containers are
organised in _collections_.
A _collection_ is a set of images which share a common ancestor; a base layer.
See https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/#images-and-layers[docs.docker.com: About storage drivers | Images and layers].

Currently available collections are the following:

* `debian/buster` based on https://hub.docker.com/_/debian[debian:buster-slim]
** Available as https://gcr.io/hdl-containers/debian/buster[image:https://img.shields.io/badge/-gcr.io/hdl--containers/debian/buster-555555.svg?longCache=true&style=flat-square&logo=Google%20Cloud&logoColor=f2f1ef[title='Google Container Registry']]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Image names and tags in this documentation are provided without the _registry prefix_.
Hence, one of the prefixes listed above needs to be used when actually pulling/using the images.
See link:ug/index.html[User Guide] for further details.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some tools are available in multiple collections, while others are built in a subset only.
Browse the registries and/or the Continuous Integration workflows for finding images available in collections other than
Debian Buster.
====

== Tools and images

By default, latest development versions (branches `master`|`main`) of tools are built.
Then, smoke tests are executed and, if successful, the corresponding images are updated in the registries.
However, some specific tools are _not_ built from sources, but installed through system package managers.
Those are marked with `!` in the table below.

[NOTE]
====
Package images are not to be used for executing the tools, but for composing images including multiple resources.
See link:dev/index.html#_package_images[Development: Package images] for further details.
